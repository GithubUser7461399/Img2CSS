Img2CSS is a Java GUI tool that converts your images into HTML and CSS pixel art to make your websites beautiful. It works by converting an image into a downscaled JPEG, with a set amount of user defined colours, then by iterating over the image it generates a <div> matrix, or a matrix of any other text that the user is free to specify. The tool might be able to generate some ASCII art for your neofetch too.

HOW TO RUN:
Download, compile, run.
